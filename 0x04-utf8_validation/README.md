0x04. UTF-8 Validation Description This project involves validating whether a given dataset represents a valid UTF-8 encoding using Python. The primary focus is on understanding bitwise operations, the UTF-8 encoding scheme, and how to manipulate data at the byte level. UTF-8 is a variable-width character encoding that can encode all possible characters (code points) in Unicode, using one to four bytes per character.

Learning Objectives By the end of this project, you should be able to:

Understand and apply bitwise operations in Python. Comprehend the structure and rules of the UTF-8 encoding scheme. Validate UTF-8 encoded data by analyzing byte-level data. Implement list manipulation and boolean logic in Python. Requirements Environment: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, Python 3.4.3 Style: PEP 8 (version 1.7.x) Execution: All files must be executable, starting with #!/usr/bin/python3 Documentation: Include a README.md file and proper code documentation for modules and functions. Task: UTF-8 Validation Objective Create a Python function validUTF8(data) that determines if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

Function Prototype python Copy code def validUTF8(data): """ Check if a given data set represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

Args:
    data (List[int]): List of integers representing bytes of data.

Returns:
    bool: True if data is a valid UTF-8 encoding, else False.
"""
Input A list of integers, where each integer represents a byte of data. Output Return True if the data is a valid UTF-8 encoding; otherwise, return False. Examples python Copy code data = [65] print(validUTF8(data)) # True, 'A' is a valid single-byte character

data = [80, 121, 116, 104, 111, 110, 32, 105, 115, 32, 99, 111, 111, 108, 33] print(validUTF8(data)) # True, "Python is cool!" in ASCII

data = [229, 65, 127, 256] print(validUTF8(data)) # False, invalid continuation byte and an out-of-range byte Concepts and Resources Bitwise Operations in Python:

Understand bitwise manipulation, including AND, OR, XOR, NOT, and shifts. Python Bitwise Operators UTF-8 Encoding Scheme:

Understand how characters are encoded in UTF-8, including the rules for one to four bytes per character. UTF-8 Wikipedia The Absolute Minimum Every Software Developer Absolutely, Positively Must Know About Unicode and Character Sets Data Representation:

Handle data at the byte level, using only the least significant 8 bits of each integer. List Manipulation in Python:

Work with lists for iterating through data, accessing elements, and using list comprehensions. Python Lists License This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
