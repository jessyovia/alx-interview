# Minimum Operations

This project involves calculating the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly `n` H characters in a text file, using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.

## Requirements

- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All files should end with a new line
- The first line of all files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should be documented
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.x)
- All files must be executable

## Function Prototype

```python
def minOperations(n).
